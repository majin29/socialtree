This open-source code is for the development of an application to connect Web2 social media & links with Web3: Social Tree

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can access the [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Edit this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
